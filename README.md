## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a backend developer specialized in Java, with solid experience in the design and implementation of microservices and RESTful APIs. I have advanced knowledge of Java, C++, Python, and JavaScript, and a strong technical foundation in clean architecture principles, including hexagonal and onion architectures. I have worked under agile methodologies (Scrum) and applied development practices such as TDD, BDD, and DDD, along with reactive programming, gRPC, and GraphQL.

My experience also includes the implementation of CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins and Azure DevOps. I work with both relational (SQL) and non-relational (NoSQL) databases, and have developed solutions deployed on major cloud platforms including Google Cloud Platform, AWS, Oracle Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

Currently, I am expanding my technical skill set in frameworks and technologies such as Node.js, Express, Django, Flask, .NET, Angular, and React, reinforcing this knowledge through personal development projects that complement my professional experience.

I am recognized for my teamwork, results-oriented mindset, and commitment to technical excellence. My medium-term career goal is to become a software architect, contributing to the strategic design and evolution of robust, scalable, and business-aligned software solutions.
